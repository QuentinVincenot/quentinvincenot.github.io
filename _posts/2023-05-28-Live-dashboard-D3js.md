# Live Dashboard with D3.js

This personal project presents a live/dynamic web dashboard implemented in HTML/CSS and D3.js. This is a completely personal project, only designed for fun, and with no other specific intention. I am no expert in D3.js, but I am really passionate about **Data Visualisation** and I had always wanted to create something with the D3.js library.

The various sources used to explore and create this project were the following :
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) official website
- [D3.js Graph Gallery](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/)

The live dashboard is published thanks to Github Pages and is available at this address :
[Live Dashboard](https://quentinvincenot.github.io/live-dashboard-d3js/)

You can find under a handmade GIF of the resulting website and live dashboard :
