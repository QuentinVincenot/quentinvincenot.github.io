> A Data Quality Management Plan is a *continuous plan of improvement and monitoring* of **Data Quality**.

## 1. Goals & objectives

**"Why do we need to do this ?"** could be the first question you could ask yourself before considering to write a Data Quality Management Plan.
However, the answer can be quite simple given your company thought either one of those two things:
"*We have Data Quality issues harming our business, let us solve them.*" or "*Data Quality is essential in our Business Strategy.*".
Given these considerations, Data Quality is considered as one of your top-priority, and you should address it consequently.

The goal of a Data Quality Management Plan is to **define the company goals in terms of Data Quality**, and the whole set of activities, metrics and monitoring that go with it.
Data Quality should be seen as a *continuous set of activities, or a long-term and regularly updated program*, generally speaking.
It has never been a one-shot project action to fix Data Quality issues, but it can be seen as a regularly reviewed program of long-term improvement and automation.

Of course, any good Data Quality program should be tightly linked and **aligned with the company Data Strategy**.
This means *business objectives have already been defined* for the company, with the related metrics and monitoring plans.
These are the basic starter points for an efficient Data Strategy on a professional scale.
The Data Quality Management Plan should serve these goals in one way or another, and Data Quality is often an essential part of a company Data Strategy.

Specify areas of Data Quality (with biggest impacts)  
When Data Quality is considered as a priority in a company given its business and data strategies, it can be easy to get lost between all the considerations to take into account.
The "*Start small, think big*" strategy is often applied regarding such important subjects, as results in areas with the strongest impacts on your business goals should drive your whole strategy. It is almost impossible to believe one action will solve everything, but continuous questionning and improvements could.
