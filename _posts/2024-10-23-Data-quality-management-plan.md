> A Data Quality Management Plan is a *continuous plan of improvement and monitoring* of **Data Quality**.

## 1. Goals & objectives

**"Why do we need to do this ?"** could be the first question you could ask yourself before considering to write a Data Quality Management Plan.
However, the answer can be quite simple given your company thought either one of those two things:
"*We have Data Quality issues harming our business, let us solve them.*" or "*Data Quality is essential in our Business Strategy.*".
Given these considerations, Data Quality is considered as one of your top-priority, and you should address it consequently.

The goal of a Data Quality Management Plan is to **define the company goals in terms of Data Quality**, and the whole set of activities, metrics and monitoring that go with it.
Data Quality should be seen as a *continuous set of activities, or a long-term and regularly updated program*, generally speaking.
It has never been a one-shot project action to fix Data Quality issues, but it can be seen as a regularly reviewed program of long-term improvement and automation.

Of course, any good Data Quality program should be tightly linked and **aligned with the company Data Strategy**.
This means *business objectives have already been defined* for the company, with the related metrics and monitoring plans.
These are the basic starter points for an efficient Data Strategy on a professional scale.
The Data Quality Management Plan should serve these goals in one way or another, and Data Quality is often an essential part of a company Data Strategy.

When Data Quality is considered as a priority in a company given its business/data strategies, it can be easy to get lost between all the considerations to take into account.
The "*Start small, think big*" strategy is often applied regarding such important subjects, as results in **areas with the strongest impacts on your business goals** should drive your strategy.
It is almost impossible to believe one action will solve everything, but continuous questionning and improvements could.

## 2. Assessment of Data Quality status

Once your goals are clear regarding your Data Strategy subjects linked to Data Quality, it is time to **assess your current state in terms of Data Quality** in the company.
This can be done by *conducting audits, tests and evaluations* on the considered perimeters of interest.
It is crucial to have a clear view of your company Data Quality status as a starting point, before starting any large scale program that could be difficult to drive or monitor.

Your current status can be described by the Data Quality criteria you monitor, and the **amount of Data Quality issues** you can detect/assess.
Naturally, being able to *pinpoint your company weaknesses regarding Data Quality issues* in the first place is mandatory.
Manually extracting issues or automating checks are two possibilities to assess and prevent business flaws.

Aside of detecting Data Quality issues, your company should **evaluate their impact on the business** you drive, the decisions you take and the customers you target.
Is Data Quality *hurting your capacity to address the market*, to unlock new possibilities or to drive your current business strategy ? By how much, and why should you focus on Data Quality ?

**Gathering insights and metrics** can help answer these questions, internally or outside the company.
It is absolutely essential to evaluate your status based on your market share, and to *conduct root cause analysis and data exploration* to gain a better understanding.
Establishing a baseline on where you are, based on quantified metrics, will help setting up goals and targets.

## 3. Development of Data Quality processes

Your current status assessed, it is time to **develop Data Quality processes and procedures** to meet your expectations.
Defining processes of fixing bad quality data, documenting procedures to update datasets and databases, and *unifying the stakeholders behind a common goal* is important to improve Data Quality in the company.

Proposing **Data Quality rules** can help data experts and actors to have guidelines and roadmaps regarding the company Data Strategy goals.
Establishing *protocols, standards or even data policies* are the way towards Data Quality global improvement.
All these elements should build the main framework of working with data within a common environment.

Paired with these Data Quality rules, protocols or data policies, the relevant **roles and responsibilities should be clarified and communicated**.
Many parts have their role to play in Data Quality management, such as the Data Governance Manager, Data Stewards or even the various Data Engineers in the company.
Defining *each of these roles and their respective daily missions* is essential in making Data Quality management a collaborative work.

With defined processes, rules and roles, it still remains to **establish clear protocols to maintain/improve Data Quality** on a day-to-day basis.
Even if the complete framework is defined and communicated to all stakeholders, *monitoring its application and the evolution of the key metrics* can help making sure the program is on track based on concrete figures.

## 4. Implementation of Data Quality tools

An important toolkit to implement and measure Data Quality are the **data profiling techniques**.
Exploring these techniques and experimenting on what they can offer in terms of monitoring and automation is essential to get a good grasp on the current and evolving status of your initiative.
When we go into more concrete details regarding Data Quality rules and considered Data Assets, it is really important to be able to *watch how these elements change over time*.

**Data Cleansing processes** are another point that is also linked to automation and Data Quality implementation.
Cleaning data is a very consequent part of a Data Quality program, considered as a "curating" step of the global pipeline.
Formatting data, deleting irrelevant points, and *defining all these corrective actions* are part of a Data Quality Management Plan.

Implementing **Data Quality dashboards** is also an efficient way to *track, monitor and work on your day-to-day Data Quality concerns*.
Having these information at hand, with your current status, the elements to focus on, or a global trend to compare your starting point and your current status can be helpful to drive your initiative and make sure you are on track.

Last but not least, all **Data Quality efforts should be automated if possible**.
Whether you have automated data preparation and cleaning workflows, regular data profiling results sent by mail, or Key Performance Indicators automatically computed everyday, it is very important to lower the amount of manual work and efforts on such costly actions.
