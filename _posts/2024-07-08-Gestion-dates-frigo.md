This personal project tries to organize data about purchased groceries, and sort them in categories and by priority date. Simple functionalies are available, such as adding a new product and put it in a dedicated category with a specified date, and deletion of one or all products already registered. Data are saved and persisted thanks to cookies for 30 days long.

The application is published thanks to Github Pages and is available at this address :  
[Gestion des dates de péremption](https://quentinvincenot.github.io/gestion-dates-frigo/)

You can find under a handmade GIF of the resulting application and website :
